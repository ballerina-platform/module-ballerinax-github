[GitHub](https://github.com/) brings together the world's largest community of developers to discover, share, and build better software. From open source projects to private team repositories, GitHub is an all-in-one platform for collaborative development.

The `github` is a [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) connector for GitHub.

This connector provides operations for connecting and interacting with GitHub GraphQL API endpoints over the network.
